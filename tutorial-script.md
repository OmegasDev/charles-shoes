# Building Charles-shoes Luxury Website — Real Dev Walkthrough with Bolt AI

---

## 🎬 INTRO — The Client Brief & My Approach

"So I got this project from a client — they wanted a luxury shoe brand website for Charles-shoes. Handcrafted footwear, premium positioning, the whole nine yards.

When I understood what they wanted, I immediately hopped on Bolt to structure everything. And honestly? Best decision I made.

Let me walk you through how I built this — mixing manual coding with some smart AI assistance from Bolt. This isn't some perfect tutorial — this is real development, real decisions, real problem-solving.

Let's start with why I chose Bolt for the foundation."

---

## 🤖 Why I Started with Bolt (Clip #1)

"Look, I could've started from scratch, but why reinvent the wheel?

Bolt handled the heavy lifting — proper project setup, meta tags for SEO, clean folder structure. Things that are important but honestly, kinda boring to set up manually every time.

```bash
# Bolt generated this foundation:
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS configured
- Proper HTML meta tags
- SEO-friendly structure
- Clean component architecture
```

The beauty of Bolt? It gives you production-ready foundations. No more forgetting meta descriptions or messing up the initial Tailwind config.

But here's where it gets interesting — I didn't just copy-paste everything."

---

## 🛠️ The Foundation Bolt Built (Clip #2)

"Bolt set me up with a solid React + TypeScript + Tailwind stack. But the real value was in the details:

- Proper HTML structure with accessibility in mind
- SEO meta tags already configured
- Responsive breakpoints set up correctly
- Clean component organization

```html
<!-- Bolt made sure I had proper meta tags -->
<meta name="description" content="Premium handcrafted shoes..." />
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

This stuff matters for real client work. Bolt saved me probably 2 hours of setup time.

Then I started customizing everything for the luxury brand feel."

---

## 🎨 Custom Design System — Where I Took Control (Clip #3)

"This is where I went full manual. Luxury brands need that custom touch.

I built a sophisticated color palette:
- Deep navy primary colors for elegance
- Gold accents for that premium feel
- Cream backgrounds for warmth

```js
// My custom Tailwind config
colors: {
  primary: {
    700: '#334155',
    800: '#1e293b', 
    900: '#0f172a',
  },
  gold: {
    500: '#d4af37',
  },
  cream: {
    100: '#faf7f2',
  }
}
```

Fonts? Inter for body, Playfair Display for headers. Clean but elegant.

When I hit roadblocks with the color system, I'd ask Bolt quick questions to debug. Super helpful for those 'why isn't this working' moments."

---

## 🧭 Navigation — Vibe Coded with Bolt's Help (Clip #4)

"The navbar was one of those sections I vibe coded with Bolt's assistance.

I wanted:
- Sticky navigation that changes on scroll
- Smooth mobile hamburger menu
- Active state highlighting

```tsx
const [scrolled, setScrolled] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => {
  const handleScroll = () => setScrolled(window.scrollY > 50);
  window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
}, []);
```

When my scroll detection wasn't working right, I asked Bolt to debug it. Turned out I was missing the cleanup function in useEffect.

This is the beauty of having AI assistance — quick debugging without getting stuck."

---

## 🦸 Hero Section — Pure Manual Craft (Clip #5)

"The hero section? This was all me. You can't vibe code emotion.

```tsx
<h1 className="text-6xl font-serif text-cream-100">
  Built Different. <span className="text-gold-500">Worn Bold.</span>
</h1>
```

That tagline came from understanding the brand. The gradient background, the animations, the call-to-action placement — all manual decisions based on luxury brand psychology.

But when I needed to implement the animations properly, Bolt helped me get the keyframes right."

---

## 💬 WhatsApp Integration — Smart Business Decision (Clip #6)

"Every luxury brand needs easy customer contact. WhatsApp is perfect for this market.

I built a floating component that:
- Animates gently in the corner
- Opens with pre-filled messages
- Collects customer details first

```tsx
const whatsappUrl = `https://wa.me/2347063329071?text=${encodeURIComponent(message)}`;
```

This was mostly manual coding, but I used Bolt to help structure the form validation logic. Why struggle with form state when AI can help?"

---

## 🖼️ Gallery — Where Bolt Really Shined (Clip #7)

"The gallery was complex — filtering, responsive grids, hover effects.

I started coding it manually, but the filter logic was getting messy. So I asked Bolt to help clean it up:

```tsx
const filteredShoes = activeFilter === 'all' 
  ? shoes 
  : shoes.filter(shoe => shoe.category === activeFilter);
```

Bolt also helped me make the mobile filter scroll horizontal instead of stacking vertically. Smart suggestion that I wouldn't have thought of immediately.

This is where AI assistance really pays off — handling the tedious logic while you focus on the creative stuff."

---

## 🔨 Process Page — Storytelling Meets Code (Clip #8)

"The process page tells the craftsmanship story. This needed to be perfect.

I designed the alternating layout manually — understanding the brand story is human work.

But when I wanted to add timeline animations and make sure the responsive behavior was smooth, I collaborated with Bolt on the implementation details.

```tsx
// Alternating layout logic
className={`flex flex-col lg:flex-row items-center gap-12 ${
  index % 2 === 1 ? 'lg:flex-row-reverse' : ''
}`}
```

The creative decisions were mine. The clean code implementation? That's where Bolt helped."

---

## 💼 Services Architecture — Collaborative Approach (Clip #9)

"Services page needed to be comprehensive but not overwhelming.

I outlined the structure manually:
- Main services with features
- Pricing transparency  
- Service guarantees

But I used Bolt to help organize the data structure and ensure all the cards had consistent heights across different content lengths.

```tsx
// Bolt helped me structure this cleanly
const mainServices = [
  {
    icon: <MessageCircle />,
    title: "Personal Consultation",
    features: [...],
    duration: "1-2 hours",
    price: "Complimentary"
  }
];
```

This collaborative approach — human strategy, AI implementation — works really well."

---

## 📖 About Page — Pure Brand Storytelling (Clip #10)

"The about page is where brands live or die. This was 100% manual work.

Understanding the founder's story, the company mission, the emotional connection — that's human insight.

I wrote every word, chose every image placement, designed every section to build trust and connection.

Bolt helped with the responsive layout and making sure the founder's image displayed properly across devices, but the storytelling? That's all human."

---

## 📞 Contact Integration — Smart Form Handling (Clip #11)

"Contact page needed multiple touchpoints — form, WhatsApp, social links.

I designed the user experience manually, but used Bolt to help with the form handling logic:

```tsx
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const whatsappMessage = `Hi Charles-shoes,
Name: ${formData.name}
Email: ${formData.email}...`;
  
  const whatsappUrl = `https://wa.me/2347063329071?text=${encodeURIComponent(whatsappMessage)}`;
  window.open(whatsappUrl, '_blank');
};
```

This kind of integration work — where you need clean, bug-free code — that's where AI assistance really shines."

---

## 💰 Investor Page — Business Strategy (Clip #12)

"Not every site needs an investor page, but this client had growth ambitions.

I researched what investors want to see, structured the content strategically, wrote the projections based on market research.

Bolt helped me organize the data presentation and make sure the metrics displayed cleanly:

```tsx
const metrics = [
  { value: "500+", label: "Satisfied Clients" },
  { value: "1000+", label: "Pairs Crafted" },
  // ...
];
```

Strategy is human. Clean implementation is where AI helps."

---

## 📱 Mobile Optimization — Collaborative Debugging (Clip #13)

"Mobile-first is non-negotiable for luxury brands. Customers browse on phones.

I designed the mobile experience manually, but when certain elements weren't behaving right on different screen sizes, I'd ask Bolt to help debug:

'Why is my gallery filter not scrolling horizontally on mobile?'

Bolt suggested the scrollbar-thin utility and proper overflow handling. Quick fix that saved me 30 minutes of CSS debugging."

---

## ✨ Animations & Polish — Creative + Technical (Clip #14)

"Luxury brands need that premium feel. Subtle animations, smooth transitions.

I designed the animation strategy manually:
- Fade-ins for content
- Hover effects for interactivity  
- Floating animation for WhatsApp

But implementing the keyframes and making sure they performed well? Bolt helped optimize the CSS:

```css
@keyframes float {
  '0%, 100%': { transform: 'translateY(0px)' },
  '50%': { transform: 'translateY(-10px)' },
}
```

Creative vision + technical execution = better results."

---

## 🚀 Debugging & Problem Solving (Clip #15)

"Real talk — I hit bugs. Import errors, responsive issues, animation glitches.

Instead of spending hours on Stack Overflow, I'd ask Bolt:
'This component isn't importing correctly, what's wrong?'
'Why isn't my mobile menu closing on route change?'

Quick answers, back to building. That's the real value of AI assistance — keeping you in flow state instead of getting stuck on technical details."

---

## 🌐 Deployment & Client Delivery (Clip #17)

"Deployment was straightforward:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then push to GitHub, connect to Netlify. Site goes live.

But here's what made this project successful:
- Bolt handled the foundation properly
- I focused on brand strategy and user experience
- AI helped with technical implementation
- Result: professional site delivered faster

Client was happy. That's what matters."
