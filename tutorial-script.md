# Building a Luxury Shoe Website with React & Tailwind CSS - Complete Tutorial

## Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)
"Hey developers! Welcome back to my channel. Today we're going to build a stunning luxury shoe website from scratch using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This is going to be a complete, production-ready website for Charles-shoes - a luxury handcrafted footwear brand.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have learned how to create a modern, responsive website with beautiful animations, proper routing, and a professional design system. Let's dive in!"

## Project Setup (0:30 - 2:00)
"First, let's set up our project. I'm using Vite for fast development and hot reloading."

```bash
npm create vite@latest charles-shoes-website -- --template react-ts
cd charles-shoes-website
npm install
```

"Now let's install our dependencies. We'll need React Router for navigation, Lucide React for icons, and Tailwind CSS for styling."

```bash
npm install react-router-dom lucide-react
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

"Let me configure Tailwind CSS with our custom design system. This is crucial for maintaining consistency throughout our luxury brand."

## Design System Setup (2:00 - 4:00)
"Every luxury brand needs a cohesive design system. Let's set up our color palette, typography, and animations in the Tailwind config."

*Show tailwind.config.js file*

"I'm creating a sophisticated color scheme with:
- Primary colors in deep navy tones for elegance
- Gold accents for luxury appeal  
- Cream colors for warmth and readability
- Custom fonts: Inter for body text and Playfair Display for headings"

"I'm also adding custom animations like fade-in, slide-up, and a floating effect for interactive elements."

## Project Structure (4:00 - 5:00)
"Let's organize our project with a clean, scalable structure:"
